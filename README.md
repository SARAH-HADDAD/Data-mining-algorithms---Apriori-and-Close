# Association Rule Mining Application
This application allows you to perform Association Rule Mining using two algorithms: Apriori and Close. It takes a CSV file as input and generates the corresponding association rules.
## Requirements
The application requires Python 3.7 or later and the following packages:
* pandas
* numpy
* tkinter
* itertools
* collections
* matplotlib.pyplot
* csv
# How to Run
To run the application, open a terminal window and execute the following command:
### python GUI.py
#### Once the application window opens, select the desired algorithm from the drop-down menu. Select a CSV data file by clicking the "Select Data File" button. Enter the appropriate parameters for the selected algorithm. The parameters vary depending on the selected algorithm.
Finally, click on the "Run" button to execute the algorithm and display the resulting association rules.
The association rules will be displayed in a new window.
## Supported Algorithms
The application supports the following algorithms:
* Apriori
* Close
## Input Data Format
The application requires that the input data be in CSV format. The first row of the CSV file should contain the column names, and each subsequent row should represent a transaction.
## Output Format
The application displays the association rules.
